# Parametric tests, such as the t-test or the z-test, 
# are based on knowledge about the population distribution, or the sampling distribution. 
# Parametric tests typically have high statistical power and are therefore good 
# alternatives. To be able to use this kind of test you may need to show that your 
# data is at least approximately normally distributed. Let us try some strategies
# for testing normality, and you will get to practice more programming.

#why we need the , after the 0 or 1:
# Indexing in a data.frame using hard bracket has the format [rows, columns] 
# Look at activity 1: dim(body[body$Gender==0,]) Rows where Gender==0 are selected. 
# The position after the comma is for selecting columns. When left empty, 
# all columns are selected.

# To get a simultaneous overview of many variables it's convenient to use boxplot. 
boxplot(body)

# You may want to keep variables of similar range in separate graphs to see better.

#NOTE: In some cases you can produce correct solutions that are not recognized 
# by the automated grader. Don't get angry. Please just try a few different alternatives
# and test your code in R. You will find the right one! 
# That's the ultimate code grader ;)

# Look carefully at the box plot for shoulder_girth.
# Draw a histogram to get a closer look. What can be said about the shape 
# of the distribution for the variable shoulder_girth? 

hist(body$Shoulder_girth)

# bimodal (has two peaks) and  symmetrical 

# Shoulder_girth turned out to be bimodal. What other variable in 'body' could 
# be used to split Shoulder_girth in unimodal distributions? The automatic grader
# is picky. Use the exact name from just before Activity 1 ;) 

# answer gender
boxplot(body$Shoulder_girth~body$Gender)
# for males
hist(body$Shoulder_girth[body$Gender==1])

# A better visual check of normality than a boxplot or a histogram 
# is the so called Q-Q plot (quantile-quantile plot). A Q-Q plot is a scatterplot 
# of quantiles of two distributions. If the distributions are similar in shape, 
# the plot will come out as a straight line x=y.

# (See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_probability_plot)

# Try this code:
  qqnorm(y=body$Shoulder_girth); qqline(y=body$Shoulder_girth); ?qqnorm()
  
  # Change the code to draw a QQ plot for the male subject only. 
  # Write one code string in each box below. First qqnorm, then qqline.
  ?qqnorm()
  qqnorm(y=body$Shoulder_girth[body$Gender==1]);
  qqline(y=body$Shoulder_girth[body$Gender==1])
  
  # Notice how the dots in the QQplot for males centre beautifully around 
  #the x=y line. This is clearly a normal distribution which is great news! 
  # Because, it means that you can use a parametric test to ask questions.
  
# Write code for testing whether the mean Shoulder_girth differs between males 
  #and females.
  
  # The null hypothesis would be: There is no difference in means. 
  #H0: µ males = µ females
  
  # The alternative hypothesis would be: There is a difference in means. 
  #H1: µ males ≠ µ females
  
  t.test(body$Shoulder_girth ~ body$Gender, var.equal=T)
  # There are more ways of writing the arguments for t.test() since the number 
  # of measurements is so large, a z-test would be a resonable approximation.
  
  # p-value < 2.2e-16. I know from the comments that 2.2e-16 is the value of .
  # Machine$double.eps - the smallest floating point number such that 1 + x != 1, 
  # but of course R can represent numbers much smaller than that. 
  
  # Which statements are true about the result of the t-test in the activity above
  # A. The null hypothesis was rejected 
  # C. The p-value was below 0.05 
  # D.  There is a true difference in mean Shoulder_girth between men and women 
  
  # We suggest that you continue to explore other variables in the body 
  # dataset you have used for the activities 1-10. Or, move on to some other datasets.
  
  # Look for a quantitative variable on at least interval scale. 
  # Use boxplot() , hist(), qqnorm() and qqline() to check normality.
